treasuremap
===========

Hello, 

My name is Francesc Qui–ones.

The basic structure of this problem is an abstract class with Map methods.
Depending on the solve approach, the subclass is forced to implement the solve approach.

Each maven test executes its version primitive or OO.

I developed 4 approaches of the treasure map question:

Coding approach:
With primitive types / OO oriented

Solving approach:
Iterative / Recursive:

The quickest approach is the iterative with primitive types one.
This is 10 times faster than OO approach

The most code readable version is OO oriented one.
